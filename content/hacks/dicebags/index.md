title: 'Microfiber Dice Bags'
---

OK, they're not entirely microfiber. But they're lined with microfiber
cloth, and that's close enough.

The idea for this project came from playing around with scraps of lens-cleaning
fabric that are usually handed out for free with eyeglasses. When folded in half,
the usual cut of these bits of cloth make bags that are roughly the right shape
for

The *motivation* for this project came from me realizing I had nothing to give
to a [friend of mine](https://pratyushavi.com/), who was (a) planning to
propose to his partner and (b) had me visiting him while the whole proposal
thing was being planned.

My friend, his partner, and I are all fans of TTRPGs, and my [local
hackerspace](heatsynclabs.org) was hosting a sewing night the very night before

The three bags are double-faced. The inner lining is made of microfiber, and
the outer material is made of cotton. They are machine-stitched, and the
topmost part of the bags is turned over to create a corridor for the
drawstrings. I had some gear-shaped ornaments laying around, which now cap the
ends of the drawstrings.
lying around.

The patterned navy blue bag went to my friend, the orange bag to his partner,
and I kept the solid blue bag. The blue bag stores my [bronze dice](/hacks/dice).
