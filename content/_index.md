I write about math, engineering, and computers. Sometimes I make artsy things.
Artwork, blog posts, and cool pictures about cool things I've made can all be
found below, or on the [hacks](/hacks) page.

I like tabletop RPGs, and Pathfinder 2e is the system I've run the most. I also
enjoy cooking spicy food, hiking through deserts, and reading sci-fi.

Academic papers and preprints are listed in [research](/research). My academic
interests are varied, but generally fall somewhere between CS theory and
systems. Within theory, I mostly like thinking about combinatorial problems
emerging from engineering, anything involving graphs, and complexity theory.
Within systems, I care about functional programming, emergent behavior, and
performance, performance, performance.
