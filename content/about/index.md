# I'm `agentelement`.

I write about math, engineering, and computers. Sometimes I make artsy things.
Artwork, blog posts, and cool pictures about cool things I've made can all be
found in [hacks](/hacks).

I like tabletop RPGs, and Pathfinder 2e is the system I've run the most. I also
enjoy cooking spicy food, desert hiking, sci-fi and fantasy.

Academic papers and preprints are listed in [research](/research). My academic
interests are varied, but generally fall somewhere between theory and systems.
Within theory, I like thinking about graph-theoretic problems emerging from
something physical, often electrical engineering (but I like everything in theory). Within systems, I care about
functional programming, emergent behavior, and performance, performance, performance.
