# I'm `agentelement`.

I write about math, engineering, and computers. Sometimes I make artsy things.
You can find my art page [here](/art) and my blog
[here](/posts).

My primary interest in math is graph theory. I have too many interests in
computer science to label any one as being a primary interest. Though
functional programming, discrete algorithms, and cool (or sufficiently weird)
hardware are all contenders for the top spot.

I'm a huge tabletop RPG player, and Pathfinder 2e is the system I've run the
most. I also enjoy cooking, hiking, reading, and 3D-printing.
